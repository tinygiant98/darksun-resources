This particular design has the triangle in a horizontal arrangement. The advantages of this design is that all the pullers' ropes are joined to the beam at the same height, so they all reach their maximum leverage and pull at the same moment of the launch -  giving a potential for a more explosive effort. The triangle also supports the axle, making it easier to build the axle assembly rigid. Movement here can have a large effect on the side-to-side accuracy of the machine. The major disadvantages are that the pullers all reach the point where their efforts have no effect (when their ropes are in line with the beam) at the same time, after which the beam is coasting. The engine has very fast reload time. With a crew of 3, This  particular machine can shoot several times a minute, projectiles of about 10Kg to a distance of about 50 meters. Also since this type has a single upright beam and is very small, construction is very fast and very easy."

This particular design has the triangle in a vertical arrangement and has an additional weight at the base of the triangle. Such hybrid machines, using both counterweights and manual pulling power are also called Bricole. The advantages of the vertical formation is that The pullers each reach their maximum and minimum efforts at slightly different times thus giving a more even and longer application of power. This allows the machine to throw heavier projectiles. The major disadvantage is that the pullers' maximum efforts and leverage cannot occur at the same time, losing   the explosive team burst of power. The engine has very fast reload time. With a crew of 8, This  particular machine can shoot several times a minute, projectiles of about 25Kg to a distance of about 200 meters."

A large chamber is created underneath the foundations by excavating the soil; the wall above being temporarily supported by wooden props. Between these props the miners place combustible material. Once the chamber is deemed to be sufficiently large, the combustible material is set on fire and the miners withdraw. The supporting props eventually burn through and the wall collapses into the chamber. Once a mine is begun, the only defense against it is ounter-mining; i.e. the defenders dig their own tunnel hoping to break in to that of the besiegers and halt its construction or try to flood it. Of course, a good moat can prevent mining altogether."

The mangonneau is an enormous machine which requires the presence of 12 artillerists and  a chief of operation. The lever is lowered using a winch operated  by two wheels, six people are necessary because the counterweight  weighs several tons. When the lever is lowered the pocket of the  sling can be armed with a large stone ball or even several stones. The chief of operation gives the signal, the lever is released and  a group of gunners are suspended on the cords and accelerate the  upswing of the sling. The aiming process is rather long and one  must often carry out many tests. This machine can launch a heavy  projectile of about 100Kg only every approximately two hours, but  as soon as the calibration is finished the damage caused to fortifications is considerable. The projectile can reach a distance  of up to 150 meters. The Rather complicated nature of the reloading mechanism and the  enormous counterweight, produce a great deal of stress on the  frame, this in turn, massively reduces the life span of the mechanism."
